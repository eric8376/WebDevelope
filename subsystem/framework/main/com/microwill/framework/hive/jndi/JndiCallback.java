 * is valuable in simplifying error handling, which is performed by the
 * JndiTemplate class. This is a similar to JdbcTemplate's approach.
 *
 * <p>Note that there is hardly any need to implement this callback
 * interface, as JndiTemplate provides all usual JNDI operations via
 * convenience methods.
